# Web Project Script
A batch script that automatically creates all crucial web files to speed up your work.

## Download
<a href="https://github.com/Rademenes16/Web-Project-Script/releases/download/1.0/web.bat">v1.0</a>

## How does it work?
It's really simple. The script creates a folder filled with 3 files and assets subfolder. The files are: index.html, styles.css, main.js. Project folder is generated at the same location as the batch script.

Inside of the index.html file you'll see the following code:
```<!DOCTYPE html> 
<html lang="en"> 
<head> 
    <meta charset="UTF-8"> 
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge"> 
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"> 
   <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="styles.css"> 
    <title></title> 
</head> 
<body> 
</body> 
</html> 
```
You can edit that as you like. The HTML code above is a commonly used snippet.
## The purpose
The goal of this script is to speed up your work by reducing your time on creating/saving files and checking if all things are ok. With this script all you have to do is to pick a name for your project and press enter. Everything is automated so it's way faster than doing it manually.


## How it looks like:
1.Pick a name for your project. I used "test" in this case.

### Precautions:
<ul>
  <li>Always name a folder. Skipping this step will possibly mess up your current directory.</li>
  <li>Don't use space in the project's name for the same reason. If you must separate words then better use hyphen (-) or something similiar.</li>
  </ul>
